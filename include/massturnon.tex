\subsection{dijet mass turn-on}
\label{section: dijet mass turn-on}

The lowest single jet un-prescaled trigger in 2015 was HLT\_j360, in 2016 was HLT\_j380,
in 2017 and 2018 is HLT\_j420 which is avaliable in full Run 2 data.
The trigger selection will will bias the mass spectrum at low mass region, to avoid this bias, so an additional mass cut will be appied. 

To measure the $m_{jj}$ turn-on in data, an unbiased sample was obtained using the HLT\_j360 trigger, only data collected in 2015 corresponding to 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ is used in this measuerment.

Figure \ref{fig: mass turn-on yStar 0.6} shows the efficiencies as a function of $m_{jj}$ for $|y^{*}|<0.6$ in two g-tag regions, applying directly either triggers, respectively. The $m_{jj}$ value of the plateau ($\geq$99.5\%) is 1100 GeV. Figure \ref{fig: mass turn-on yStar 0.8} shows the efficiencies as a function of $m_{jj}$ for $|y^{*}|<0.8$ in two g-tag regions, the plateau value is 1200 GeV.
