General

- Use ATLAS predefined variables for quantities... 

Introduction...  

- remove referral to 2015/16  analysis and update for full Run II
- remove contact etc... 
- Push Q?G earlier... 
- Remove 1.3

Benchmark 

- {Are we going to use NLO k-factors. If not remove this bit}
- {Need H$^\prime$ write up}
- {If doing comparison limits will we use \qstar\ }
- {Will we use morphing?}


Event Selection 


- Clean up formulae.
	- check significance formulae as it has too many braces and is hard to follow...
	- remove 2 TeV points from Fig 10 add in 6 and 7 TeV? 
	
	
Mass Turn On

	- We really need plots with 5% of the data randomly slected from the whole run. 
	- We are using the lowest prescale with the smallest amount of pile up to 
	show the turn on works this needs updating 
	
	Fig 12 & 13.
